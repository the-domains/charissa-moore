# This is me.

One this blows up, people will want to know why I started this corner of the internet. Honestly, I am tired of not remembering the focal points of my year. I'm turning 27 in less than a month. 

I'm also moving to Phoenix after 25 years in Denver. I'm working outside the house (still for myself) for the first time since I started my former company in 2014\. It's weird, you know -- change, that is. 

27 will bring change. It'll bring some intense experiences. I'm sure it'll bring laughter and memories too -- if only to help soothe the transition to a new home, new environment, and new friends. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous... 

Honestly this scares the shit out of me, but I'm doing it anyway. I've always been good at adapting, no matter how much I want to fight it at the start. This will prove no differently than times before. 

So... welcome to the craziness that is my 27th year. The robots helping me build this site hope you have a great time. (I do too.)

Grab a chai, kick off your shoes, and stay a while.
