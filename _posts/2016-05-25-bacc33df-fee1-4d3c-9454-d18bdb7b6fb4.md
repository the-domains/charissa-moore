# full moon, full energy 

I am always surprised at how the moon affects the seasons of my life, now that I've been paying attention. It happens for my patients, too. Once they focus on what the moon's doing, and how they're synced (or not synced) with it, their life becomes more fluid. More open. More serene. More aligned and magical. 

The full moon is when energy peaks, and we're "Queen of Freakin' Everything". It's when partners want to be closest to us, when we can manifest in light speed, and when we're literally birthing and creating projects, ideas, business plans, relationships, and more -- on the spot. 

The full moon is like a blooming. An expansion of energy. A creative blossoming that allows you access to your feminine, almost unrestrictedly so. It's social week; the days when you're most primed energetically and hormonally to be around other people in a setting that's social. 

For me, that means this week is my "work out of the house week". I'm literally working at Panera, Starbucks, or a local café nonstop this week. Every day I am in one place in the morning, and a second place in the afternoon, just to change up my environment -- and I thrive that way. Next week, it's a different story. I won't want to be out as much, and I definitely won't be looking through a magical, happy, starry lens. It'll be much more detail focused, planning focused, and laser-pointed toward the future and what's coming ahead.
